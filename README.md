 I decided to create a Smart AC watt-hour meter after experiencing a spike in my electricity bill that left me both shocked and curious. Each month, I tried to be mindful of my energy use, but I realized I had no clear way to track which appliances were consuming the most power or when. I also noticed that many homes and businesses around me faced similar challenges, unaware of their real-time energy usage, leading to unnecessary expenses and often wasting power.
        With my interest in electronics and IoT, I knew I could build a solution to monitor power consumption accurately. I wanted to design a device that could give me real-time feedback on voltage, current, power, and even environmental conditions, like temperature and humidity, that might affect energy usage. I also wanted to be able to access this information remotely, so I integrated Wi-Fi, allowing data to be monitored and controlled via an online dashboard.
        Adding safety features was crucial. I included a vibration sensor and magnet sensor to detect tampering, a flame sensor for fire alerts, and a relay to remotely shut off when needed. This project quickly turned into more than just a personal need; it became a tool I could offer to others to manage energy responsibly.
        Creating this Smart AC watt-hour meter has been incredibly fulfilling. Not only am I reducing my own energy costs, but I'm also contributing to a sustainable approach to power usageâ€”one smart meter at a time.
